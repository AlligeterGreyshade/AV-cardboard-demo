# AV-cardboard: Prebuilt Set

## This is an Apple-Vision clone project made to prove that you dont need to pay 5000 dollars for AR goggles.

## This project includes: Gallery app, Camera app, Modded Youtube, Google and 3D SBS video search engine.

## The home screen has QUICK ACCESSED GUI and alot of storage space for images, videos and TXT files. It will also have an AUDIOBOOK feature which can be accessed with the built-in voice assistant called Keyko (KEY, COpe).

## `The difference beetwen Prebuilt Set and System Set is that PS uses Seperate system from Android and Iphone.`

## `The advantages of PS (Prebuilt Set) is its portability and smaller size, but it cant have more features unless more development is put into it.`

## `The advantages of SS (System Set) is that you can copy any app from your phone into it (except YT and SBS Search engine) at the cost of your phone's storage space and portability.`

# System Set will be developed soon.

# Prebuilt Set will be developed soon.
